Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Aaron,

I am writing to you from a cosmic spaceship in a remote galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a maroon rocket in August. There are 8 children and books of tree here! In the
study room there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
69 Years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
sleeping on a beautiful skateboard!!

Best wishes,
Forrest Gump
